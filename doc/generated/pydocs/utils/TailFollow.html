<h1 class="title">TailFollow</h1>
<p>TailFollow enables a user to read new data as it is appended to a file
in a manner similar to a 'tail -f' command.  As a file is moved or
rotated (perhaps as part of a log rotation mechanism), TailFollow can
continue to read from the file as it moves until a new file is created
in the original location.</p>
<p>The simple (non-tracking mode) usage of TailFollow is as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
tail = TailFollow(&quot;/var/log/syslog&quot;)
for line in tail:
    print line,
tail.close()
</pre>
<p>When tracking changes to a file, usage is as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
while 1:
    tail = TailFollow(&quot;/var/log/syslog&quot;, track=1)
    for line in tail:
        print line,
    time.sleep(1)
tail.close()
</pre>
<p>It is important to insert a delay to avoid a busy loop in which the
TailFollow tries to determine if the file has moved.  Failure to do so
will result in excessive CPU consumption when the end of file occurs.</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>class <cite>TailFollow(object)</cite>:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Tail a file and follow as additional data is appended.
TailFollow can be used to monitor log files.  It can also track
when a the file has been moved (perhaps by a log rotation script).
In this case, TailFollow will automatically close the old file,
and re-open the new file.</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<dl>
<dt><cite>__init__(filename, track=1)</cite>:</dt>
<dd>Constructor that specifies the file to be tailed.  An
optional keyword argument specifies whether or not the file
should be tracked.</dd>
<dt><cite>__iter__()</cite>:</dt>
<dd>Returns an iterator that can be used to iterate over the
lines of the file as they are appended.  TailFollow implements
the iterator contract, as a result, self is returned to the
caller.</dd>
<dt><cite>next()</cite>:</dt>
<dd>Returns the next line from the file being tailed.  This
method is part of the iterator contract.  StopIteration is
thrown when there an EOF has been reached.</dd>
<dt><cite>close()</cite>:</dt>
<dd>Closes the current file.</dd>
